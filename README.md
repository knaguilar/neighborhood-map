# About
Welcome to my neighboorhood map. This project is Udacity Front End Nanodegree's 5th Project. This map was inspired by my trip to Barcelona and my excitement to share some great spots to visit. In this map you will find a couple locations in Barcelona that are worth checking out if you are ever in the area. The map is also interactive in the sense that you can click on a location either from the list or on the map to learn a bit more about that place. I hope you enjoy!

## Getting started

To get started, you can visit the page located [here](https://knaguilar.github.io/neighborhood-map/)

or you can download the github repo and open index.html

## Displayed
When the app is first opened it will display a Google Map located in Barcelona, Spain with 6 locations already marked. There will also be a small hamburger icon on top of the map that will slide a locations list and filter functionality.

## Features
1) With this app you can click on a marker and have more information about the location displayed to you. The selected marker will also bounce to stand out from the rest.

2) You can also click on the menu icon and choose a location from the list. The selected location will bounce on the map to let you know where it is located.

3) Along with the list options, you can also filter the list and display only certain markers on the list. For example, if you only want Park GÃ¼ell to appear, the filter would make the other markers disappear.

4) Simply click on the menu icon to make the filter/list disappear and have the map display in full screen.

5) Along with the name of the location on the marker, the infowindows also show a related wikipedia article on that place so you can learn more about each location.

## Attributions:
I used Google Maps Api to display the map and set up markers with inforwindows etc.
I also used Wikipedia's Api to display an article title and link to learn more about each location.

Other attributions for code are included as comments where the code was used. A huge thanks to Udacity's various courses that helped to understand how to build this app.
